# Hey, I'm Achraf

Engineering student at INPT Rabat, building real things with Java, React, and way too many Docker containers.  
I like systems that are clean under the hood — good architecture, proper security, no shortcuts.

Currently working on **TechBuzz**, leading algo sessions at Club CIT, and hunting for a summer internship.

### What I've shipped

**FlowLeave** — Leave management ERP at Azura Group. Three BPMN workflows, five roles, automated emails, role-based dashboards. Built with Spring Boot and Flowable, tested end-to-end with JUnit 5 and Mockito.

**FlowBoard** — A production-ready task management API I built to go deep on Spring Boot patterns: JWT auth, Redis caching, rate limiting, async notifications, full Swagger docs. The kind of backend you'd actually want in prod.

**TechBuzz** *(in progress)* — Tracks what's blowing up on Twitter/X and Reddit in real time. Event-driven backend, D3.js visualizations (heatmaps, bubble charts), neural network for predicting what's about to trend.

**DevOps pipeline** — Took a 3-tier app from zero to full DevSecOps: Docker, Kubernetes, GitLab CI with SAST/SCA/DAST, ArgoCD for GitOps, Vault for secrets, Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring. Auto-kills the pipeline if CVSS > 5.

**RAG Chatbot** — AI coach built on Retrieval-Augmented Generation. PDF knowledge base, FAISS vector search, multi-turn memory, Gemini 2.0 Flash for responses. Live on Render.
