### About Me

I'm a curious and self-driven developer who enjoys tackling real-world problems through clean, well-engineered solutions.  
I've worked on everything from backend Java systems and DevSecOps pipelines to RAG-based AI chatbots and real-time data visualizations.  
Currently leading the Algorithmics Cell at Club CIT INPT and looking for a summer internship to keep growing.

### Experience

**Backend Java Developer Intern — Azura Group** *(June – August 2025)*  
Built FlowLeave ERP, a leave management system with 3 automated BPMN workflows (annual, medical, emergency), RBAC authentication across 5 roles, automated SMTP notifications, and a role-based Thymeleaf/Bootstrap dashboard. Tested with JUnit 5 and Mockito; PostgreSQL in production, H2 in dev.
